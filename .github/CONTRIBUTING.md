# Contributing

### So, you want to contribute to Neutrino?

Thank you for wanting to help out with Neutrino! We are very happy that you want
to contribute, and have put together this guide to help you get started. We want
to do our best to help you make successful contributions and be part of our
community.

### Participation Conduct

In order to ensure everyone has a fair, pleasant, and inclusive experience
contributing to Neutrino, we ask that you abide by our
[community participation guidelines](./code-of-conduct.md), based on the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Please read and
understand it for everyone's benefit.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the
developers managing and developing Neutrino. In return, we will show you respect
in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull
requests.

### What we need

There is always room for improvement and expansion in Neutrino. Some things that
could always help:

- Triaging and fixing bugs
- Adding tests to Neutrino which can help ensure it functions properly with new
  contributions
- Keeping core presets up to date with the best webpack and Babel options
- Expanding documentation, writing tutorials, and creating example projects
- Something else, of course!

### What we probably don't need

While we are happy to review **any** contribution, there are some things that
are best left as an external project:

- _Additional presets_. While "neutrino" does contain a number of core presets,
  we created and maintain these because they were core to most of the projects
  we personally work on. If there are more presets you believe should be
  maintained by the core, then feel free to raise an issue and we can discuss!
  Most likely though, additional presets can be externally maintained and
  published to npm. It still has the same reach potential as bringing it into
  the core, without raising the maintenance burden for Neutrino unnecessarily.
- _Scaffolding and boilerplates._ The goal of Neutrino is to remove
  over-reliance on boilerplates, instead opting to push users into consuming
  presets. Neutrino itself will not add commands to scaffold out new projects or
  create boilerplate repositories. We do keep a collection of
  examples-as-documentation for getting started with Neutrino presets, but do
  not wish to govern project structure more than necessary. These types of
  projects can be maintained externally.

## Support

Neutrino team members and contributors are here to help you! Should you need
assistance or have questions in using Neutrino or its core presets, please
consider asking on our Spectrum channel, Stack Overflow, or other channel rather
than filing issues. We would prefer to keep our GitHub issues clear for bugs,
feature requests, discussions, and relevant information related to its
development.

## Guidelines

- Please make a good-faith effort to ensure that code that goes into Neutrino
  follows the existing patterns and quality that is already present in the
  repository.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.
  Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Strive for code to be readable. Prefer following functional programming
  paradigms over object-oriented ones where possible.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per
  version.

## Getting started

Most contributions will involve working with the neutrino codebase. Please refer
to the [development documentation](./development.md) for technical details on
getting started.

## Filing bugs and issues

When filing an issue, try to answer these questions:

- What version of Neutrino are you using?
- Are you trying to use any presets? If so, which ones, and what versions?
- Are you using the Yarn client or the npm client? What version?
- What version of Node.js are you using?
- What operating system are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened, contrary to your expectations?

## Feature Requests or Enhancements

Please file an issue describing your request in detail:

- What is the goal of the change?
- What are the pros and cons of the change?
- Could this dramatically improve the experience of our users?

Please be open to discussion, and we will respect your time by fairly evaluating
your request. In the event that your request is deemed to not be acceptable to
move forward, please understand that isn't a criticism of you as a person, but
rather that the idea in its present form may not be right at this time. We
respect you and your ideas, and will always encourage contributors to continue
to make proposals.

## Code review process

Code is reviewed by Neutrino team members for quality, conformance to existing
patterns, and functionality.
