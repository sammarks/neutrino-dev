# Support

Neutrino team members and contributors are here to help you! Should you need
assistance or have questions in using Neutrino or its core presets, please
consider asking on our Spectrum channel, Stack Overflow, or other channel rather
than filing issues. We would prefer to keep our GitHub issues clear for bugs,
feature requests, discussions, and relevant information related to its
development.
